* spec for get request helper method
* update feed_data request so that if include_feed is true and its expired it regets the feed, or remove include_feed all together, or remove incrementing

##Lower Priority

* change name references from feed to response
* d3 / angular visualization of feed request patterns
* feed domain level counts
* go through Google Reader API and see if there's features that sound like they'd be good to add
* feed reformatting
* performance testing
* duplicate content checking using hashing
* authentication
* threading or multiple processes
* access individual items in feeds
* cleaner way of checking if redis instance is running and abort app if not
