##Probably Good Ideas

* configuration of time to live on application boot
* d3 / angular visualization of feed request patterns
* feed domain level counts
* Go through Google Reader API and see if there's features that sound like they'd be good to add
* add rackup file
* find better place to initialize redis client
* figure out stubbing so it can be done directly on redis client instead of Redis.any_instance
* gemify / set up bundler and deployment

##Lower Priority / Possible Bad Ideas

* feed reformatting
* performance testing
* master / slave redis server deployment
* configurable db backup
* server fail over protection
* server capacity manager
* duplicate url checking
* Database replication
* accurate counts / other meta data across multiple database set up
* admin console
* authentication
* threading or multiple processes
* access individual items in feeds
